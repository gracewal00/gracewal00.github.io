### CPSC 120

* Lab 4

    Lab 4, part 2 was a favorite of mine mainly because I liked that it required two players. I enjoyed using if statements to create a system where player 2 had more than one guess. This lab felt like a good start for creating simple games for users to play. 

* Lab 7

    Lab 7 was one of my favorite labs because I found it cool to use images to formulate our code. I liked that we had to figure out how to implement the various restrictions on our own. My group had to problem solve logic errors that we ran into with our if statements.

* Lab 8

    I liked both parts of lab 8, but part 2 really stood out to me. Even though it was not as complex as some of our other assignments, it felt like a different way to use our code. I had a good time trying to figure out how to implement the nested loop in order to get the image that I wanted.
